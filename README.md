## Prayer Time Configuration

Users can provide custom prayer times using a CSV file.
This allows the system to work for any country or city.

### CSV Format
```
Month,Day,Fajr,Sunrise,Dhuhr,Asr,Maghrib,Isha
```

### Sample

```
Month,Day,Fajr,Sunrise,Dhuhr,Asr,Maghrib,Isha
1,1,06:10,08:10,12:15,13:50,16:09,17:55
1,2,06:10,08:10,12:15,13:51,16:10,17:56
1,3,06:10,08:10,12:16,13:52,16:11,17:57
1,4,06:10,08:10,12:16,13:53,16:12,17:58
...
```

Note:
All non-prayer events (Nawafel, Athkar, and Quran playback) are configured through the Scheduler Settings GUI Desktop Application.

## System Architecture

The system is built on two main pillars:

### 1. Background Services

- Scheduler Service
  - Reads a Python mapping configuration file
  - Iterates through scheduled events
  - Triggers a playback script by passing:
    - Event name
    - List of MP3 audio files

### 2. Desktop Applications

- Prayer Time GUI
  - Displays:
    - Countdown to the next prayer time
    - Color-coded prayer time status (green, gray, red)

- Scheduler Settings GUI
  - Provides full control over:
    - Event-to-audio mapping
    - Playback schedules
    - Custom audio selection
